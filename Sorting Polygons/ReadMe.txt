When executing the jar from command line, 
ensure your cmd is pointed to where the sort.jar file is present.

The format for arguments is as follows:

java -jar sort.java -fFilename -tCompareType -sSortType

For example:

java  -jar sort.jar –fpolyfor5.txt –Tv –Sq

The order of the file, compare type and sort type do not matter.
